# ML_AbalonesAgeGrp

Abalone Age Group Classification 

Objective: To classify abalones into different age groups from 4000+ samples based on their physical characteristics

• Performed Mean value, Median value, KNN & Random Forest Imputation techniques on the dataset to fill up the missing values in the input features & concluded that Imputation using KNN regression gives best results
• Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost classifier, Multi-class Neural Network on the processed dataset 
• Performed Hyperparameter tuning of the classifiers & acquired around 90% accuracy on Neural Network Classifier
